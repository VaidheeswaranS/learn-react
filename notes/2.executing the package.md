## Parcel

more details here - https://parceljs.org/

`Parcel` does couple of things behind the scenes,
- Dev Build (building the things locally)
- Local Server (hosting the contents in the local server running on a specific port)
- HMR - Hot Module Replacement (each and every time we save the application file it is replacing with new contents that is saved)
- It is doing the HMR using the `File Watching Algorithm` which is written in C++
- It also uses a Caching named `parcel-cache` which is used to build our app faster
- It does Image Optimization
- It does Minification when we build production ready build
- It will do Bundling
- It will do Consistent Hashing
- It will do Code Splitting
- It is do Differential Bundling - it supports older browsers
- Tree Shaking - It will remove the unused code
